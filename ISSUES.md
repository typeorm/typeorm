### Potential Duplicate Issues:

**1. PostgreSQL Replication Pool Options:**

- `11980 OPEN Support separate pool options for master and slave connections in Postgres new feature, requires triage 2026-02-13T14:27:19Z`
- `11972 OPEN Support individual poolSize for master/slave in PostgreSQL replication new feature, requires triage 2026-02-12T15:44:21Z`
  These two issues appear to be requesting similar functionality regarding pool configuration for master/slave connections in PostgreSQL.

**2. `@RelationId` Decorator Issues:**

- `11956 OPEN You cannot filter by properties with the @RelationId decorator. new feature, requires triage 2026-02-11T10:22:25Z`
- `11955 OPEN Cannot select @RelationId() fields in findAndCount() — Property "categoryId" not found bug, requires triage 2026-02-02T10:37:18Z`
- `11483 OPEN @RelationID makes crash on select due huge query built bug, requires triage 2025-05-17T07:42:20Z`
  These issues all relate to problems or limitations when using the `@RelationId` decorator, particularly with filtering and selection.

**3. `invalidWhereValuesBehavior` Behavior:**

- `11818 OPEN invalidWhereValuesBehavior.undefined set to `throw`is not throwing when is not the only property in`where` bug 2025-12-03T17:47:36Z`
- `11806 OPEN createQueryBuilder ignores invalidWhereValuesBehavior.undefined: 'ignore' 2025-12-03T12:53:58Z`
  These two bugs describe unexpected behavior with the `invalidWhereValuesBehavior` setting in `createQueryBuilder`.

**4. `getManyAndCount` Functionality Issues:**

- `11744 OPEN Query Builder getManyAndCount() returns incorrect data and count when used in conjunction with pagination + join + a condition on the joined column bug, regression 2025-11-09T21:27:49Z`
- `10980 OPEN getManyAndCount throws an error when DISTINCT is missing an alias bug, requires triage 2025-10-31T09:38:15Z`
- `7250 OPEN getManyAndCount() fails but getMany() doesn't with advanced queries (ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR) bug, driver: mysql, requires triage 2025-09-18T16:13:21Z`
  These issues all highlight problems with the `getManyAndCount` method, especially when combined with other query features like joins, distinct, or advanced queries.

**5. SQLite Driver Issues:**
Several issues relate to the SQLite driver, covering various aspects like `jsonb` support, collation, driver compatibility with Node.js versions or package managers, Expo Web integration, and boolean behavior. While not exact duplicates, they represent a cluster of concerns around the SQLite driver's functionality and compatibility:

- `11930 OPEN TypeORM does not allow jsonb on sqlite bug, requires triage 2026-01-20T17:55:01Z`
- `11907 OPEN sqlite: `loadTables` method unable to get collation bug, requires triage 2026-01-09T12:00:11Z`
- `11858 OPEN better-sqlite3 / sqlite driver is not working well in nestjs typescript env. bug, requires triage 2025-12-20T06:43:21Z`
- `11830 OPEN TypeORM does not find installed SQLite3 package under pnpm bug, requires triage 2025-12-17T12:03:04Z`
- `11678 OPEN TypeORM + SQLite on Expo Web raises Error bug, requires triage 2025-10-10T14:47:26Z`
- `11643 OPEN SQLite & Boolean : READ and WRITE behaviors are not consistant 2025-10-11T09:34:36Z`
- `11236 OPEN How can support bun native sqlite drive? new feature, driver: sqlite, requires triage 2025-12-18T09:31:20Z`
- `11164 OPEN Does TypeORM Support node:sqlite? driver: sqlite, new driver, requires triage 2025-09-19T00:02:53Z`
- `1884 OPEN SQLite connection pool discussion, documentation, driver: sqlite 2025-12-13T14:46:13Z`

**6. SAP HANA Driver Issues:**
Similar to SQLite, there are multiple issues specific to the SAP HANA driver covering connection pooling, parameter binding, HDI containers, date handling, default entity saving, named constraints, and migration schema names.

- `11619 OPEN SAP Hana Connection Pooling is broken since 0.3.26 by design, driver: sap hana 2026-01-02T22:20:55Z`
- `11565 OPEN SAP HANA cannot bind array parameter bug, requires triage, driver: sap hana 2025-07-18T09:42:09Z`
- `11558 OPEN Add feature to support SAP HANA HDI containers new feature, requires triage, driver: sap hana 2025-07-03T17:03:21Z`
- `11414 OPEN SAP HANA: `QueryBuilder`parameter of type JS`Date` not escaped correctly bug, driver: sap hana 2025-12-22T21:22:12Z`
- `11349 OPEN SAP HANA: cannot save entity only with defaults bug, accepting PRs, comp: query builder, driver: sap hana 2025-06-17T13:56:40Z`
- `11348 OPEN Allow explicitly named constraints in SAP HANA new feature, accepting PRs, comp: indices, driver: sap hana, size-m, stale 2025-09-17T18:17:22Z`
- `10099 OPEN Remove schema name from migrations for SapQueryRunner comp: migrations, driver: sap hana 2025-09-19T12:52:20Z`

This analysis highlights areas where issues might be consolidated or where developers might be facing similar underlying problems.
