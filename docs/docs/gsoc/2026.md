# TypeORM – Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Idea List

This document outlines potential GSoC project ideas for TypeORM. Each idea includes a description, goals, expected outcomes, and difficulty level.

---

## First-Class Polymorphic Relations in TypeORM

### Description

TypeORM currently lacks native support for polymorphic relations (a single relation pointing to multiple entity types). Users rely on workarounds that are hard to type, error-prone, and inconsistent across databases.

### Mentors

- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals

- Design a first-class polymorphic relation API for TypeORM
- Ensure compatibility with existing relation decorators
- Provide migration and schema synchronization support

### Expected Outcomes

- New decorator(s) for polymorphic relations
- QueryBuilder support for polymorphic joins
- Clear documentation and examples
- Backward-compatible implementation

### Difficulty

Medium - Expected 175 hours

### Required Skills

TypeScript, ORM internals, SQL schema design

---

## Improved Type Safety and Inference Across TypeORM

### Description

Despite being written in TypeScript, TypeORM has several weakly typed areas (relations, query builder results, repository methods). Improving type inference would significantly enhance developer experience and correctness.

### Mentors

- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals

- Improve relation type inference (lazy and eager relations)
- Strongly type `QueryBuilder` results
- Reduce `any` usage in public APIs
- Improve generics for `Repository` and `EntityManager`

### Expected Outcomes

- Better compile-time guarantees
- Fewer runtime errors
- Incremental, non-breaking improvements
- Documentation of recommended typing patterns

### Difficulty

Medium - Expected 175 hours

### Required Skills

Advanced TypeScript, generics, library API design

## Vector Support: Types, Indexing, and Search Across Databases

### Description

Vector embeddings are increasingly common in modern applications (AI, search, recommendations). While TypeORM has partial support for vector column types, it lacks a unified and complete solution for vector storage, indexing, and querying across databases.

This project aims to provide end-to-end vector support in TypeORM, covering vector column types, database-specific mappings, vector indexing, and high-level vector search abstractions.

### Mentors

- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals

- Add vector column support for remaining databases (e.g. Oracle)
- Investigate SQLite limitations and support `libsql` vectors where possible
- Define a consistent, cross-database vector column API
- Implement vector index support where databases allow it
- Expose vector similarity queries via `QueryBuilder`
- Implement a high-level vector store abstraction on top of repositories
- Optional: explore knowledge-graph-style queries (e.g. SPARQL-inspired APIs)

### Expected Outcomes

- New `@Column({ type: "vector" })` support across databases
- Database-specific vector mappings, fallbacks, and limitations
- Cross-database vector index support
- High-level vector search and similarity query APIs
- Extensible architecture for future AI and search-related features
- Clear documentation and examples

### Difficulty

Medium — Expected 175 hours

### Required Skills

SQL dialects, database internals, TypeORM driver architecture, indexing strategies, query optimization, API design

## Modularization of Entity Definition APIs

### Mentors

- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Description

TypeORM currently supports two different ways to define entities: class-based entities (decorators) and entity schemas. Over time, these two approaches have diverged, with entity schema support often lagging behind class-based entities in features and type safety.

This project focuses on extracting and modularizing entity definition styles into clearer, better-isolated components, with the goal of keeping both approaches in sync and enabling future architectural improvements. Rather than attempting a full monorepo restructuring, the project targets a well-defined and achievable subset of that work.

### Goals

- Extract entity definition logic into clearly separated modules or packages
- Improve parity between class-based entities and entity schemas
- Explore a function-based entity definition API with strong type inference
- Reduce duplication between entity definition styles
- Lay groundwork for future modularization (e.g. CLI, logging, caching)

### Expected Outcomes

- Better synchronization of features between entity schemas and class-based entities
- Cleaner internal abstractions for entity metadata definition
- Improved type inference for non–class-based entity definitions
- Clear boundaries that make future refactoring and modularization safer

### Difficulty

Hard - Expected 350 hours

### Required Skills

TypeScript, TypeORM metadata system, API design, large codebase refactoring

## SQL Dialect Abstraction for Custom Driver Development

### Description

Adding or maintaining database drivers in TypeORM is currently complex and tightly coupled to existing driver implementations. Introducing a clearer SQL dialect abstraction would make it easier to support new databases and reduce duplication across drivers.

This project aims to define and introduce a SQL dialect layer that encapsulates database-specific SQL behavior, enabling easier development of new drivers and better separation of concerns within TypeORM.

### Mentors

- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Naor Peled](https://github.com/naorpeled)

### Goals

- Design a SQL dialect abstraction that captures database-specific behavior
- Extract common SQL generation logic from existing drivers
- Define clear extension points for implementing new dialects
- Document how to build a custom driver using the dialect system

### Expected Outcomes

- A well-defined SQL dialect interface
- Reduced duplication across existing drivers
- Improved maintainability of current drivers
- Clear pathway for community-contributed database drivers

### Difficulty

Hard - Expected 350 hours

### Required Skills

SQL dialects, database internals, TypeScript, TypeORM driver architecture

## Open Call for Community-Proposed Ideas

TypeORM welcomes Google Summer of Code project ideas proposed by contributors and community members.

If you have experience with TypeORM and have identified pain points, missing features, or architectural improvements, you are encouraged to suggest a GSoC project idea.

Suggested ideas may include (but are not limited to):

- Improvements to existing drivers or database support
- Performance optimizations
- Developer experience and tooling enhancements
- Documentation or testing infrastructure improvements
- New features

Proposed ideas should include:

- A short problem statement
- Expected outcomes and scope
- Estimated difficulty
- Relevant technical areas (TypeScript, SQL, drivers, etc.)

Community-proposed ideas will be reviewed by maintainers and may be added to the official GSoC project list.
