# TypeORM – Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Idea List

This document outlines potential GSoC project ideas for TypeORM. Each idea includes a description, goals, expected outcomes, and difficulty level.

---

## First-Class Polymorphic Relations in TypeORM

### Description
TypeORM currently lacks native support for polymorphic relations (a single relation pointing to multiple entity types). Users rely on workarounds that are hard to type, error-prone, and inconsistent across databases.

### Mentors
- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals
- Design a first-class polymorphic relation API for TypeORM
- Ensure compatibility with existing relation decorators
- Provide migration and schema synchronization support

### Expected Outcomes
- New decorator(s) for polymorphic relations
- QueryBuilder support for polymorphic joins
- Clear documentation and examples
- Backward-compatible implementation

### Difficulty
Medium - Expected 175 hours

### Required Skills
TypeScript, ORM internals, SQL schema design

## Improved Type Safety and Inference Across TypeORM

### Description
Despite being written in TypeScript, TypeORM has several weakly typed areas (relations, query builder results, repository methods). Improving type inference would significantly enhance developer experience and correctness.

### Mentors
- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals
- Improve relation type inference (lazy and eager relations)
- Strongly type `QueryBuilder` results
- Reduce `any` usage in public APIs
- Improve generics for `Repository` and `EntityManager`

### Expected Outcomes
- Better compile-time guarantees
- Fewer runtime errors
- Incremental, non-breaking improvements
- Documentation of recommended typing patterns

### Difficulty
Medium - Expected 175 hours

### Required Skills
Advanced TypeScript, generics, library API design

---

## Vector Type Support Across Databases

### Description
Vector embeddings are increasingly common in modern applications (AI, search, recommendations). TypeORM has partial support for vector column types across many databases.

### Mentors
- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals
- Add vector column support for remaining databases (e.g. Oracle)
- Investigate SQLite limitations and support `libsql` vectors where possible
- Define a consistent, cross-database vector column API

### Expected Outcomes
- New `@Column({ type: "vector" })` support
- Database-specific mappings and fallbacks
- Documentation describing supported databases and limitations

### Difficulty
Easy - Expected 90 hours

### Required Skills
SQL dialects, database internals, TypeORM driver architecture

---

## Vector Indexing and Vector Store Abstractions

### Description
Beyond storing vectors, applications require vector indexing and similarity search. TypeORM could provide unified abstractions for vector indices and vector-based queries across databases.

### Mentors
- [Lucian Mocanu](https://github.com/alumni)
- [Mohammad Gomaa](https://github.com/g0maa)

### Goals
- Implement vector index support where databases allow it
- Expose vector similarity queries via QueryBuilder
- Implement a high-level vector store abstraction on top of repositories
- Optional: explore knowledge-graph-style queries (e.g. SPARQL-inspired APIs)

### Expected Outcomes
- Cross-database vector index support
- High-level vector search APIs
- Extensible architecture for future AI/search features
- Optional experimental work on knowledge graph querying

### Difficulty
Easy - Expected 90 hours

### Required Skills
Databases, indexing strategies, query optimization, API design

## Open Call for Community-Proposed Ideas

TypeORM welcomes Google Summer of Code project ideas proposed by contributors and community members.

If you have experience with TypeORM and have identified pain points, missing features, or architectural improvements, you are encouraged to suggest a GSoC project idea. 

Suggested ideas may include (but are not limited to):
- Improvements to existing drivers or database support
- Performance optimizations
- Developer experience and tooling enhancements
- Documentation or testing infrastructure improvements
- New features

Proposed ideas should include:
- A short problem statement
- Expected outcomes and scope
- Estimated difficulty
- Relevant technical areas (TypeScript, SQL, drivers, etc.)

Community-proposed ideas will be reviewed by maintainers and may be added to the official GSoC project list.
